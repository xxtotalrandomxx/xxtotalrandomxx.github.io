      <h4><i>Undergraduate</i>, 2022</h4>

<p class="description" >I am an early 20's adult who is currently studying in the Digital Media Arts. Growing up, I had always wanted to create games such as those I played in my childhood. Entering this major, I had very minimal knowledge of what to expect in this new path, but I learned quickly what it is to be a Digital Media Artist.
  <br><br>
  When I entered San Jose State University, I had experienced many new concepts and skills to express my creativity. In the near future, I hope to excell in producing video games to younger generations so they can experience the same enjoyment I had growing up.
